        <h1>About Sudie Simmons</h1>
          <h3>Hi! My name is Sudie, and I am a UX Designer with a background in edtech, fintech, and patient care.<br> My previous experience has provided me with the opportunity to navigate complex information structures, to empower users to provide the best for their students, to contribute to more inclusive cultures, and to create logical, functional systems to help users better understand their own needs.<br> I instinctively prioritize the concerns, preferences, and anxieties of others, and have sought a path that relies on empathy and innovation to creatively solve problems and help others navigate their personal and professional obstacles.<br> I am a self-starter looking to work with a diverse team that values transparency, constant communication, and a warm company culture.

When I am not working on, reading about, or listening to podcasts about design, I love to read, cook, hike, and seek out new skincare products.

          </h3>
